        <blockquote class="base-text breath-top-10">Olympic Sculpture Park establishes a creative dialogue with infrastructure (railway, road approach, waterfront promenade), making it an active part of the project. Not all interventions to existing city infrastructure elements have to involve burying them or dispensing with them entirely; in some cases, this course of action will be essential, but in others these elements can become features of the whole.</blockquote>
