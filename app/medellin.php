            <strong>The Northeastern Urban Integration</strong> Project in Medelli'n (Proyecto Urbano Integral, or PUI) was initiated by the City of Medelli'n in 2004 to harness opportunities presented by the MetroCable, a new cable-car project connecting three informal settlements to the metropolitan transit system. In concert with the MetroCable, the PUI has made a significant
            contribution toward improving the quality of life for approximately 170,000 residents experiencing severe social inequality, poverty, and violence.

            <p>
            The PUI leverages the economic benefits of new mobility infrastructure to incorporate marginalized communities into the city. By reducing travel times to the city center from over an hour to less than ten minutes, the MetroCable has enhanced access to employment opportunities and eroded the boundary between the formal and informal city.

            <p>
            Working with the community to conceptualize, develop,
            and construct new open-space networks, the designers of the PUI have sensitively integrated a mobility infrastructure of the strategic goals of large and socially complex projects by developing processes that promote ownership by the community.

                    <header><h5>MEDELLI'N OVERVIEW</h5></header>
                    <p>Medelli'n is located in the Aburra' Valley in the central Andes, 1,479 meters above sea level. Known as the "City of Everlasting Spring," it has only recently become a metropolis. It is the second-largest city in Colombia (after Bogota') and the capital of the department of Antioquia. From 1938 to 2008, the population of Medelli'n increased from 168,000 to 2.34 million. This population skews relatively young, with almost 70 percent between five and forty-four years old.</p>

                    <p>Ninety percent of the population lives in about 30 percent of the city’s territory. Medelli'n is divided into 249 neighborhoods (barrios), 16 communes, and 6 zones. Of about 600,000 housing units, 77 percent are occupied by those at the lowest socioeconomic levels, while 19 percent house those in the middle and upper-middle levels. Four percent of the housing units are home to those at the highest economic level.</p>

                    <p>The city generates more than 8 percent of Colombia’s GDP, with the Aburra' Valley as a whole contributing close to 11 percent. Surpassing that of the other major cities of Colombia, the GDP per capita (with purchasing power parity) is U.S. $3,794; and corporate density is 25 companies per 1,000 people—the second highest in the country. Although Medelli'n was once known as "The Industrial City of Colombia," global and national economic dynamics have shifted the city’s focus to Medelli'n shares the Aburra' Valley with nine other municipalities, which collectively create a metropolitan urban area with a population of 3.5 million people.</p>

                    <header><h5>MARGINALITY IN MEDELLI'N</h5></header>
                    <p>The process of "informalization," understood as the formation of precarious neighborhoods, has been a characteristic of Medelli'n’s history throughout the twentieth and into the twenty-first century, a consequence of the continuous migration toward the city.</p>

                    <p>The effects of this demographic growth became evident at the beginning of the last century, in the considerable rise in the demand for housing. This heightened demand was associated with the production of working-class residences for the huge numbers of manual laborers needed in the emerging industrial sector.1 From that time on, neighborhoods created through both public and private initiatives began appearing, primarily near the northeastern bank and along the tram route and principal roads. The public residences were the product of institutions such as the Instituto Cre'dito Territorial and the Banco Central Hipotecario, while the private residences represent investments by local landowners.</p>
        
                    <p>Despite these significant public and private efforts, the demand for housing continued to grow in the following decades. A migratory wave following the rural displacement and political violence of the 1950s pushed the city’s annual growth rate to 6 percent.</p>
                    <p>
                    In ten years Medelli'n doubled its population; informal squatter settlements (urbanizaciones piratas) and illegal neighborhoods (barrios de invasio'n) began to appear in the most inaccessible peripheral areas. From this period we find the examples of Popular, Santo Domingo, and Granizal toward the eastern bank, and Doce de Octubre and Picacho toward the western bank.

                    <p>
                    Increasing in intensity, the new urbanizing dynamic began to generate profound segregation within the city’s physical, social, and economic western slopes, the informal city began to emerge; here one finds the ad hoc residences of the poor. Parallel to these areas, the middle and upper classes occupy the center and south of the valley, in the planned formal city. Medelli'n’s path diverged into two realities—two opposing "cities"—dramatically segregated by location and geographical relief.

                    <p>Thirty years later, a new wave of violence and rural displacement, combined with emerging narcotics trafficking, drove informalization in Increasing in intensity, the new urbanizing dynamic began to generate dramatic political and social directions. The neighborhoods of the profound segregation within the city’s physical, social, and economic northern slopes of the valley, commonly termed "comunas," became the order. Toward the northern and the upper parts of the eastern and habitat of illegal gangs—bands of assassins who acted on the orders of western slopes, the informal city began to emerge; here one finds the narcotics traffickers and other criminals. State control and presence in ad hoc residences of the poor. Parallel to these areas, the middle and these sectors was almost nonexistent. As a result of informalization, 25 upper classes occupy the center and south of the valley, in the planned percent of Medelli'n’s territory (a total of 2,400 hectares) now lies in formal city. Medelli'n’s path diverged into two realities—two opposing marginal neighborhoods.</p>
