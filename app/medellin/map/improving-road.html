        <h5>MPROVING THE ROAD SYSTEM: 42C, 42D, AND 43</h5>
    </header>
    <p>This project focuses on improving neighborhood streets 42C (between 118th Street and 110A Street), 42D (between 110A and 109), and 43 (between 109 and 107A).</p>
    
    <p>The proposal centers on a one-way north-to-south neighborhood axis, taking advantage of spatial continuity across the sector, a low level of traffic, and an ample supply of sidewalks and urban furniture. The interventions in public space planned for this sector echo interventions between the Popular Station and the Centrality Paul VI. The wide range of commercial ventures within this axis served as a prompt for the intervention.</p>
