    <p>The development plan for the city of Medellín deﬁnes education as a tool for the transformation of the city. This goal is promoted through the Municipal Parks and Libraries Plan, which creates spaces for study, training, and community interaction. This approach treats libraries as another dimension of public space. The public Library Park is intended to promote the development of the central area of Santo Domingo Savio. This complements existing uses and other interventions carried out as part of the northeastern PUI. The objective is to oﬀer the community both the services of a public library and a space for community encounters that include recreation, sports, and cultural activities.</p>
