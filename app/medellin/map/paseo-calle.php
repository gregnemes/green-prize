            <h5>PASEO CALLE 106, URBAN STREET PROMENADE</h5>
        </header>
        <p>Calle 106 is the first street promenade project of the area, connecting La Candelaria Park, CEDEZO, Puerto Rico street, Mirador Park, Childrenâ€™s Park, and the Santo Domingo Library. The project emphasizes pedestrian movement and involves urban furniture, tree plantings, and paved streets. The street level is a fundamental space of social life, and the local economy is encouraged with the improvement of street and sidewalks.</p>
