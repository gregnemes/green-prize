        This project redefined the area’s public space to create a pedestrian promenade and build a park close the street. The purpose was to strengthen the function of the street in its role as a pedestrian axis, providing stimulus to business activity and socioeconomic development.
        </p>
        <p>107th Street is a straight road of 660 meters between the river and the Andalucía station. A 19-meter commercial corridor experienced a great increase in activity, becoming a popular meeting place.</p>
