    <p>The Popular area is formed by the neighborhoods Popular 1 and 2, Nuevo Horizonte, and Granizal. The first ones present an organic plot settlement; the last one is defined by mixed plot settlements.</p>
    <p>Vehicle usage is restricted by topographic conditions that shape the road grid. Narrow, sinuous streets articulate and integrate pedestrian mobility. In general, the streets are between 3 and 5 meters wide and slope between 20 and 30 percent, though some are even more sharply pitched.</p>
