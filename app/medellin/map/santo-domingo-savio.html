    </header>
    <p>The Santo Domingo area is formed by the Santo Domingo Savio Number 1 neighborhood and partially by Nuevo Horizonte, Santo Domingo Number 2, Carpinelo, and Granizal. Its boundary is a product of the growth of the neighborhood and topography such as Santo Domingo hill, which limits expansion toward the west.</p>
