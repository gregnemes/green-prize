        <p>The Centros de Desarrollo Empresarial Zonal (CEDEZO), or centers for business development within the zone, is a program of the municipality of Medell√≠n, established within the overarching strategy of encouraging a culture of entrepreneurship. The CEDEZO program seeks to promote economic development through business initiatives, ultimately improving local living conditions, especially for the most vulnerable. There are currently thirteen centers.</p>
        <p>The Santo Domingo Savio CEDEZO is a joint exercise of La Candelaria Park and Building, distributed along three levels. The building is given a public terrace and continues its program on the lower floors: park administration, business incubators, and multiuse rooms. Its strategic location and the optimal use of all its levels turned it immediately into a model and a meeting place for the area. It also served as an inspiration for the design of other CEDEZOs.</p>
